## Project Description

This project provides a graphical version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, where two players take turns placing their markers (`X` and `O`) on a 3x3 grid. The game utilizes the **Pygame** library to create an interactive interface and a visual game board. The goal is for one player to align three markers in a row, column, or diagonal.
